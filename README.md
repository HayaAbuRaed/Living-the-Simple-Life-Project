# Building "Living the Simple Life" Project Using HTML and CSS

## ⚡ Overview
This project was built in order to improve my skills in HTML and CSS, but more importantly to learn how to build an exellent **responsive design** . I could say that this was my fist attempt to build a completly responsive design. As the responsivness is one of the most important fetures that the design should provide, I think designing this project is a good stage in my journey of developing my-self as a front-end web developer. The only used techniqes was the basics of HTML and CSS, since the main reason is to make a step in the world of building responsive designs.
